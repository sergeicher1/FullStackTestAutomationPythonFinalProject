    About

This project demonstrates a smart automation infrastructure that allows testing different kinds of applications and is easily maintained!

This project can execute tests on:

Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Ms. EDGE) - using the Selenium web driver

Desktop apps – using Win app driver

Electron apps – using Electron driver

Mobile apps - using Appium Studio as a server

Rest API – to test API server side 

Database – to perform data-driven tests 

Visual Testing – using applitools 

Testing framework – PyTest

HTML Reports – simple HTML report of test execution  

Allure Reports – An enhanced HTML reporting system

CI with Jenkins – the project is completely running from the Jenkins server

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Tools & Frameworks used in this project:


	PyTest – Testing Framework

	EventListeners – for console reports 

	Jenkins – for automated execution of the test cases

	Python requests – for API testing

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Test Execution: 

Each one of the Test Suites has a few tests for demonstration purposes. 
These tests can be developed very simply, due to a lot of work done with the infrastructure. [Sanity Tests]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Known Issues: 

Due to different versions of package requirements that are desired for proper execution test cases on different platforms,
you need to comment on other sections in the conftest.py script.
